### What I learned

This is my first time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. I'm already familiar with the first two and still learning more. As for JavaScript, I haven’t finished my course yet, so I’m learning as I go.

Alright, about today (02/24/2025)—I'm tired of this project, haha. The calendar is fine; it's functional, somewhat pretty, and okay overall. But I made a mistake with my initial idea regarding the rest of the functionality I wanted to add (adding an activity, editing, deleting, editing on the calendar, etc.). These were too many features for my "first project."

At this point, I'm not going to add more functions, and I'm considering deleting all the extra code and just keeping the calendar. One idea is to keep the calendar as it is so that, in the future, if someone wants to see why I was so delayed, they can check out the rest of the code with all its "excellent functionality."

What did I learn from this? Well, I realized that I should plan and organize my code before starting to program (I think vanilla JavaScript makes this harder). Also, I learned and practiced a lot of JavaScript, which was the main goal of this mini-project—to apply everything I've learned so far.

The decision to abandon the project is mainly because I still need to add too many features for the calendar to be what I want it to be. It's not that I'm not capable, but I need to keep progressing with my course, and this project is taking too much time. In a few months, I'll be able to do it more easily and make it look better.

Today is 02/26/2025, two days after I almost abandoned "the project." After I wrote the lines above, I talked with my friend Juan. He pushed me, insisting I finish it. And, honestly, I had to do it. Yes, it was difficult and overwhelming for the first thing I thought of, but it was fun.

It could probably have been better, but I'm happy with the final result.

The project take me about 67.5 hs.
